## 0.3.0

### 🎉 New features

- Automatically generated list of Android packages ([#28](https://github.com/unimodules/react-native-unimodules/pull/28))
  As of this version, you no longer need to add new packages to your `MainApplication.java` file. Just use `new BasePackageList().getPackageList()` instead 🎉. `BasePackageList` is auto-generated with a list of installed unimodules found in your `node_modules` folder during Gradle's Sync operation.
